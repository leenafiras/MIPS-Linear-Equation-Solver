# MIPS-Linear-Equation-Solver

A MIPS assembly program that reads linear equations from a file, extracts variables and coefficients, solves 2x2 and 3x3 systems using determinant methods, and displays or saves the results. It handles syntax errors, invalid systems, and supports both integer and floating-point calculations.
